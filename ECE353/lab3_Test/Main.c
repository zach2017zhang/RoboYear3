-----------------------------  Dining Philosophers  ----------------------------

  -- This code is an implementation of the Dining Philosophers problem.  Each
  -- philosopher is simulated with a thread.  Each philosopher thinks for a while
  -- and then wants to eat.  Before eating, he must pick up both his forks.
  -- After eating, he puts down his forks.  Each fork is shared between
  -- two philosophers and there are 5 philosophers and 5 forks arranged in a
  -- circle.
  --
  -- Since the forks are shared, access to them is controlled by a monitor
  -- called "ForkMonitor".  The monitor is an object with two "entry" methods:
  --     PickupForks (phil)
  --     PutDownForks (phil)
  -- The philsophers are numbered 0 to 4 and each of these methods is passed an 
  -- integer indicating which philospher wants to pickup (or put down) the forks.
  -- The call to "PickUpForks" will wait until both of his forks are
  -- available.  The call to "PutDownForks" will never wait and may also
  -- wake up threads (i.e., philosophers) who are waiting.
  --
  -- Each philospher is in exactly one state: HUNGRY, EATING, or THINKING.  Each
  -- time a philosopher's state changes, a line of output is printed.  The 
  -- output is organized so that each philosopher has column of output with the
  -- following code letters:
  --           E    --  eating
  --           .    --  thinking
  --         blank  --  hungry (i.e., waiting for forks)
  -- By reading down a column, you can see the history of a philosopher.
  --
  -- The forks are not modeled explicitly.  A fork is only picked up
  -- by a philosopher if he can pick up both forks at the same time and begin
  -- eating.  To know whether a fork is available, it is sufficient to simply
  -- look at the status's of the two adjacent philosophers.  (Another way to 
  -- state the problem is to forget about the forks altogether and stipulate 
  -- that a philosopher may only eat when his two neighbors are not eating.)
